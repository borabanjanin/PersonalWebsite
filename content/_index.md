I am a fifth year PhD Student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washington - Seattle. My advisor is [Prof. Sam Burden](http://faculty.washington.edu/sburden/) and I belong to the [BioRobotics Lab](http://brl.ee.washington.edu/). Previously, I received my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering with a focus in Controls and Embedded Systems from the same department and institution in 2013. For more details, please take a look at my [resume](/BoraBanjaninResumeSchool.pdf).

I seek to further the study and application of data-driven hybrid dynamical systems. Currently, I maintain two active projects: [(1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06745) optimal control and learning policies for mechanical systems subject to unilateral constraints and [(2)](/ISB_RosenbergMC_ExoPrediction.pdf) predicting the effect of ankle foot orthoses from subject-specific data.
